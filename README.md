# Laravel Pretty Pagination

This package generates pretty pagination URLs:

```
http://localhost/users/page/2
```

## Install

```

If you wan't to change the prefix (default is ```page```):

```php
Route::get('/users', ...)->name('users')->paginate('seite');
```

Or if you don't want to use any prefix:

```php
Route::get('/users', ...)->name('users')->paginate(null);
```

- The ```paginate()``` macro must be called as last
